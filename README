File2Code
=========
Converts a common file into a usable C source-file. All data will be put into an array and is able to use simply.


Usage
-----
file2code FILE


Example
-------
You have to bind two objects

by using 'extern':
	extern unsigned char FILE_data[];
	extern unsigned long FILE_size;

or by creating a header-file.

The array contains the unchanged data of 'FILE'. So it is not NULL-terminated and you have to to it by yourself.
	char *file = (char *)malloc(FILE_size + 1);
	memcpy(file, FILE_data, FILE_size);
	readme[FILE_size] = '\0';
